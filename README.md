### Hi, I'm Juan CamiloðŸ‘‹
I'm an economist from the EAFIT university interested in mathematics, statistics, econometrics, linear algebra, and using this knowledge with technological tools. Consequently, I like programming because it's a beautiful mechanics to solve real-world problems. For example, automate a boring report at work.

For that reason, the main idea is to share programming projects for those who want to learn how to use different tools to improve their performance, especially in economics.

### Collaborations :date:
I'm a young guy trying to learn a lot about many topics. If you find something wrong or know a different -more efficient- way to do it, I'm open to suggestions. Finally, if you want to work with me, my email is in my profile:email:.

### Repositories :clipboard:
* [Economics](https://github.com/JuanCamiloOlaya/Economics)
* [Understanding-Statistics-Using-R-CODES](https://github.com/JuanCamiloOlaya/Understanding-Statistics-Using-R-CODES)

### Coming soon.
* PronÃ³sticos restringidos (Spanish).
* Estimation frameworks for covariance matrix in portfolios analysis (Portfolio-Analysis).
* Fiscal standards <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>

### Ref.
* <a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: Firstly, this repository is a personal research proposal about debt sustainability analysis. However, the idea is to share the estimation framework.
