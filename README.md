### Hi, I'm Juan CamiloðŸ‘‹:metal:
I'm currently finishing my studies in economics at EAFIT university. Throughout my university life, I became passionate about mathematics, statistics, econometrics... things like that, and the use of this knowledge with technological tools. Consequently, I like programming in which many economics students find it difficult to dive in and learn from this incredible world. So, the main idea is to share programming projects for those who want to learn to use tools to improve their performance in economics or related areas.

### Collaborations :date:
I'm a young guy trying to learn a lot about many topics. If you find something wrong or know a different -more efficient- way to do it, I'm open to suggestions. Additionally, if you want to work with me in my profile is my email address :email:.
